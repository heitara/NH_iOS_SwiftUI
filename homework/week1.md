### Task 1: **Practice Loops**

**Objective**: Practice using loops and variables.

Create a program that counts from 1 to 10 and prints each number.
Print "Even" next to even numbers and "Odd" next to odd numbers.
Provide 3 different solutions using:
 * for in
 * while
 * repeat while 

**Example Output**:

```
1 Odd
2 Even
3 Odd
...
10 Even
```


### Task 2: **Working With Arrays**

**Objective**: Practice using arrays and loops.

Create an array of 10 favorite TV Series or movies. 
Loop through the items and do the following transformation:
* if the index of an item is divisible to 3 (no reminder) print it uppercased.
* if the index of an item is divisible to 4 (no reminder) capitalize each word.

**Extra task**: Add a new item to the array and print the updated list in full (all items).

### Task 3: **Grade Tracker**

**Objective**: Practice using dictionaries.

Store the names of students as keys and their grades as values. 
Create a program to:

1.  Print all students and their grades.
2.  Add a new student and their grade to the dictionary.
3.  Find and print the grade of a specific student.

**Extra Task**: Could you try to implemented it using array and tuple?

**Example**:
```swift
var grades = ["Alice": 85, "Bob": 90, "Charlie": 78]
```

### Task 4: **Person Details**

**Objective**: Practice using tuples.

Define a tuple with the following properties: `name` (String), `age` (Int), and `city` (String). Print each property on a separate line.

**Extra Task**: Update the city in the tuple and print the updated tuple.

### Task 5: **Shopping List**

**Objective**: Practice using constants and variables.

Write a program to:

1.  Create a constant array of 5 shopping items. Each item should has a price. (use tuples)
2.  Use a loop to print all items.
3.  Create a variable for the total cost (starting at 0). Calculate and print the total cost.

**Example Output**:
```swift
Items: Milk, Bread, Cheese, Apples, Bananas
Total cost: 50
```
