Personal Recipe Manager
===========================

Please, develop a mobile application that can be used to keep track of recipes â€” which you had cooked, are currently cooking, or you plan for the future.

Required Features:
----------------------

* Display a list of all recipes using SwiftUI.
    The recipes should be categorized into three sections: **"Cooked"**, **"Cooking"**, and **"To Cook"**.  
    Each recipe should have a title, an optional description (list of engridients) and a status.  
    The user should be able to edit the list of recipes (Add, Update and Delete).  
    All deleted recipes will be stored in a **"Recycle Bin"** and removed from there after 4 weeks.
    
* Add a new recipe to the app.
    Create a screen that can be used to add a new recipe.  
    When adding a recipe, users must enter the title, description, and an estimated cooking time (if applicable).  
    The user should be able to add multiple images or photo to a recipe.
    
* Edit recipe details.  
    Users should be able to:
    
    *   Update the cooking progress from 0% to 100%.
    *   Add images or photos of the dish through the process.
    *   Add or edit the description.
    *   Change the **status** of the recipe.
* Display cooking progress and estimated cooking time. 
    The progress should be clearly visible for all recipes in the "Cooking" section.

### **Tips:**

*   Store all data **locally** in JSON files.
*   If you want to explore **SwiftData** or **CoreData**, feel free to provide a similar implementation.
*   Use the **camera** to attach images of the recipe or ingredients.
*   Use a **photo picker** to allow users to select images from their photo library.

### **Submission Method:**

*   Upload the project to GitHub or submit a ZIP file via Google Forms.
