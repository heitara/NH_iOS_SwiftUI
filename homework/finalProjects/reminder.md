that you have done, want to do, or you are doing at the moment.

    Each task should have a title, description (optional) and status.
    The user should be able to edit the list.
    All deleted tasks will be stored in a "Recycle Bin" and removed from there after 2 weeks.

### **Tips:**

If you want to explore SwiftData and/or CoreData feel free to provide similar implementation.
Use the camera to attach images.
Use a photo picker to allow the user to select image from his/her photos.
